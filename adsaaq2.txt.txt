Step 1: Implement Dynamic Programming Algorithm
python

Step 2: Output
Optimal Parenthesization:
(( Matrix 1 ( Matrix 2 Matrix 3 ) ))

Minimum Scalar Multiplications: 48

Step 3: Explanation of Dynamic Programming Approach
Initialization: We initialize a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] stores the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to compute the matrix chain from matrix i to matrix j. The table is filled diagonally from bottom-left to top-right.

Recurrence Relation: For each subproblem of finding the optimal parenthesization between matrices i and j, we consider all possible split points k where i ≤ k < j. The cost of multiplying the matrices from i to k and from k+1 to j along with the cost of multiplying the resulting matrices is calculated. The minimum cost is stored in dp[i][j].

Reconstruction of Optimal Parenthesization: The parenthesization table is used to reconstruct the optimal parenthesization by recursively finding the split points.

Step 4: Time and Space Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is O(n^3), where n is the number of matrices. This is because we have three nested loops, each of which runs at most n times.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n^2) because we use a 2D table of size n x n to store intermediate results (dp table) and another n x n table to store split points (parenthesization table).

Step 5: Efficiency for Large Instances
The dynamic programming solution efficiently solves the matrix chain multiplication problem for large instances. Its time complexity of O(n^3) is reasonable for moderate values of n. However, for very large instances, further optimization techniques might be necessary, such as parallelization or optimization of cache usage. For general use cases, the provided solution is efficient and practical.
