You are tasked with solving the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. Your goal is to implement the algorithm, find all possible solutions for a given N, and analyze its time complexity.
1.	Implement a backtracking algorithm in Python to solve the N-Queens problem.
2.	Apply your algorithm to find all possible solutions for a given N (e.g., N = 4 or N = 8). Ensure that you generate all unique solutions.
3.	Present the solutions as chessboard representations, indicating the placement of queens (e.g., using 'Q' for queens and '.' for empty squares).
4.	Explain the backtracking approach, including how you generate and validate solutions and how you handle conflicts between queens.
5.	Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm and discuss its efficiency for larger values of N.
Input:
•	An integer N (N ≥ 4) representing the size of the N×N chessboard and the number of queens to place.
Output:
•	All possible solutions to the N-Queens problem for the given N, presented as chessboard representations.

Explanation of Backtracking Approach:
Solution Generation: The backtracking algorithm generates solutions by trying out different configurations of placing queens on the chessboard and backtracking if a solution cannot be found with a certain configuration.

Validation: The is_safe function checks if it's safe to place a queen at a particular position. It ensures that no other queens threaten the current position horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Conflict Resolution: If placing a queen in a particular column leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries the next column in the current row.

Time Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the backtracking solution for the N-Queens problem is typically high. It is not polynomial time; it's closer to exponential time complexity. For each queen placed, the algorithm explores N possibilities in the next row, leading to a total of N^N possible configurations.

For larger values of N, the number of possibilities grows exponentially, making the solution slow for larger chessboard sizes.

Despite its high time complexity, the backtracking solution is practical for relatively small N values (e.g., N = 8) where the number of solutions is manageable. For larger values of N, more advanced techniques, such as constraint propagation and heuristics, are often employed to improve the efficiency of the solution.
